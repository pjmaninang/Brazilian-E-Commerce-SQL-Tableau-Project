# E-Commerce Sales and Product Performance Analysis
## Project Overview

This Brazilian e-commerce company (synthetic) requested that a sales analysis be conducted for a specific sales period from September 2016 - September 2018. Their SQL database contains significant amounts of data on its sales, products, sellers, and even order reviews. This project thoroughly analyzes and visualizes the sales data from their database, in order to uncover key insights that will guide their company's strategic planning.

To provide a thorough sales and product performance analysis, insights and recommendations were focused around:

- **Sales Trends Analysis:** Evaluating the company's sales patterns across the country, with KPIs centered around revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV)
- **Product Performance:** Analyzing the sales data to uncover the company's top and bottom performing products in regards to the key KPIs
- **State Comparisons:** Evaluating customer distribution and sales volumes across different states in Brazil
