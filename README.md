# E-Commerce Sales and Product Performance Analysis
## Project Overview

This synthetic Brazilian e-commerce company requested a sales analysis for the period of September 2016 to September 2018. Its SQL database contains extensive information on sales, products, sellers, and order reviews. This project conducts a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the sales data to uncover key insights that can inform the companyâ€™s strategic planning.

To provide a thorough sales and product performance analysis, insights and recommendations were focused around:

- **Sales Trends Analysis:** Evaluating the company's sales patterns across the country, with KPIs centered around revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV)
- **Product Performance:** Analyzing the sales data to uncover the company's top and bottom performing products in regards to the key KPIs
- **State Comparisons:** Evaluating customer distribution and sales volumes across different states in Brazil

## Limitations

- **Incomplete Sales Data for 2016 and 2018:** Sales records for these years are cover only a small portion of the complete year, with September 2018 only having 1 order. This has resulted in understated revenue figures, as well as innacurate month-over-month percentages for the adjacent months
- **Limited Customer Demographics:** The customers table contains only customer ID and state information, limiting the ability to further aggregate or segment sales trend analysis by additional demographic attributes
